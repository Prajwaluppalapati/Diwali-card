        <div class="about">
            Diwali is the five-day Festival of Lights, celebrated by millions of Hindus, Sikhs and Jains across the world. Diwali, which for some also coincides with harvest and new year celebrations, is a festival of new beginnings and the triumph of good over evil, and light over darkness.

            Now the covid - 19 has taken over all the world. We can't go out and burst crackers so this time we should burst less crackers like flowerpot etc.
